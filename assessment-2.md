      <td align="center">There is substantial own code; the student can explain the code that exists</td>
      <td align="center">The student can explain some parts of their code, how some parts works together, and some technical choices</td>
      <td align="center">The student can explain every part of their code, how everything works together, and why software is used instead of alternatives; the project is structured logically</td>
