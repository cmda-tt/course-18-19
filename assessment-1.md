      <td align="center"><strong>Data is rendered with a framework</strong>; interpreting the representation is easier that interpreting the data itself</td>
      <td align="center"><strong>Data can be read and changed; changes to data are reflected in the interface; changes persist across page reloads</strong></td>
      <td align="center">Representation and <strong>use of a framework</strong> go beyond an example: there are demonstrable additions <strong>like routing or creating data</strong></td>

      <td align="center">There is substantial own code; the student can explain the code that exists</td>
      <td align="center">The student can explain some parts of their code, how some parts works together, and some technical choices</td>
      <td align="center">The student can explain every part of their code, how everything works together, and why software is used instead of alternatives; the project is structured logically</td>
      <td align="center">The project is complex but can easily be understood; alternatives to software covered in class was used that were great choices</td>
